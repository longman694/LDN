1. **Re** – The DC resistance of the voice coil. In the impedance chart, this will correspond to the point of minimum impedance. When you are looking at the chart, there will be a spike at resonance frequency. Then the impedance will go down and then start to rise up again, due to voice coil inductance. At the point where it starts to rise, the phase angle is 0 degrees, and the impedance is at its minimum (that is Re).
2. **fs** – The resonance frequency.
3. **Ts** – Related time constant. Ts = 1 / ωs = 1 / 2πfs .
4. **Qm** – Mechanical quality factor. This is the ratio of the parallel resistive component of the motional impedance (RM) to its reactance at resonance.
    - Qm = Rm / Xm.
    - Xm represent the combined reactance of Lm and Cm from the circuit.
5. **Qe** – Electrical quality factor. This is the ratio of the series DC resistance (Re) to its reactance at resonance.
    - Qe = Re / Xm.
6. **Qt** – Total quality factor. This is derived from the electrical and mechanical quality factors and they add up like resistances in parallel.
    - 1/Qt = 1/Qe + 1/Qm.
