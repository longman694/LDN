## Type by Order
- 1st order – 6 dB / octave slope.
- 2nd order – 12 dB / octave slope.
- 3rd order – 18 dB / octave slope.
- 4th order – 24 dB / octave slope.

## Type by 
- Linkwitz-Riley crossover – which matches the attenuation slopes, so they combine for a flat response at the crossover point.
- Butterworth crossover – which creates a small peak in response at the crossover point.
- Bessel crossover – is somewhere between the first two.
