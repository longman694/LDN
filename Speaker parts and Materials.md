# Voice Coil

- Low efficiency ~ 3-5% power convert: electric -> 3-5% acoustic power + Heat
- generating heat
### Coil
- Copper wire 
	- Eg AWG31 4 layer DCR 3.5 Ohm
- Copper clade aluminum wire
### Form
heat management
- fiber glass
- Aluminum
- poly MI film (Capton)

# Cone

- Paper -> most common
	- craft paper abaca fiber
- polypropylene -> out-door mostly woofer
- carbon fiber -> out-door in-door durable
- acrylic treat fiber

# Magnet

Ferrite - heavy, low cost, common
Neodymium - 10 time power of ferrite and also the cost
Alnico - (Aluminum + Nickel + Cobalt) very high cost, find in guitar amp


# T-Yoke

# Front plate

# Demodulating ring / Short turn / Faraday loop

Because of the pole piece of T-yoke act like a iron core of the inductance (voice coil), when the voice coil extrude out the area of iron core inside the voice coil will be reduced. That will cause a distortion, called inductance distortion


# Basket

Stamp Steel - 
Cast Aluminum - higher end


# Spider

- treated cloth

# Surround
Rubber
polyether foam



# Tinsel wire
copper wire wrap around keplar


# Dust cap


# Gasket
- compatible form


# Tweeter

## Dome

- aluminium
- aluminium-magnesium alloys
- titanium
- beryllium (hazardous)

- polyester film
- silk
- polyester fabric
- \[add] polymer resin
