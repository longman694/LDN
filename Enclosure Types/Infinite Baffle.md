- baffle that larger than 17 meters (more than the length of 20 Hz frequency)
- $V_b \gg Vas$ eg, over size enclosure, or woofer in the car

# Pros
- doesn't need much power
- less distortion compared to other
- in ideal case, there are no resonance and no diffraction issues

# Cons
- woofer can reach maximum excursion ($Xmech$) easily, prone to damage.
