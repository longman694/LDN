# Pros
- no vent resonant
- no air turbulence
- no small frequencies escapes
- space efficient
# Cons
- steep roll-off
- less transient stability
- higher cut off frequency

Vd = Sd * Xmax
Vd at least twice  as large as active speaker 

passive radiator Vd > 2 * (Speaker Vd)


# Passive radiator parameter

- Vas -> Mms and Sd
$$V_{as} = \frac{\rho \cdot c^2 \cdot S_d^2}{4\pi^2 \cdot F_s^2 \cdot Mms}$$
$\rho$ = $1204 \;Â g/m^3$ 
c = speed of sound 343 m/s


- Sd
- Fs
- Xmax
- Qms
- Mms = weight of  passive radiator cone + surround/2
- Cms -> use weight and measure?
