IB setups are pretty easy to do.  
  
If it is to be flush mounted just sim a sealed enclosure at least 10x the combined drivers Vas. This time we will use two drivers.

To do a manifold build, use an OD setting. Create a sealed rear chamber that is at least 10x the combined drivers Vas. The manifold opening needs to be at least as much as the combined Sd of the drivers. The driver is ~32cm wide, so will will make the manifold this deep, and split the depth between L12 & L23.
