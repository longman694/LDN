There is a lot to tuning a Bandpass enclosure, so I am not going to get into that right now. I will just show how to set them up. They just build upon what you have already learned in the sealed, and two vented lessons.  
  
I want to stress that these are not super tweaked example. They are just good enough to get the idea across. ![;)](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7 "Wink    ;)")  
  
Here is a 4th Order Single Reflex BP. It has one sealed chamber, and one vented chamber.

Here is a 6th Order Dual Reflex BP. It has a vented chamber on each side of the driver.

You could also do the Dual Reflex BP as a Compound Horn.  

Using the TH setting you can do a Quasi-6th Order Series-Tuned BP as well.
