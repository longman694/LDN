# Notes
- The cement formula that used in these speaker had mixed a lot off water, but still rigid enough for application. This is interesting result, more work-ability low strange but enough for the speakers.
# Improvements

- Forget to measure both speaker again after add more offset to the woofer. So, the phase of final model is a little difference from the prototype, causing phase at the crossover point is a bit off.
- Too much impedance on the high end, L-Pad will be required next time.
- Next time try to calibrate Voltage and fix measurement position and make graphs more standard.
